## Installation

Download the repository to your computer.

In your console, enter:

```
npm install
```
To start the server:

```
npm run dev
```

To compile SCSS enter:

```
npm run compile scss
```

## Usage

Get a react environment set up quickly with this boilerplate.

It includes all the modules you need. All you need to do is download the project, unzip it, run node and start building.

To run the webpack dev server, enter

```
npm run dev
```

This will get your app running on http://localhost:8080/webpack-dev-server/index.html.

Webpack will watch for changes and update the browser when a file is changed.

Use src/js/client.js to import your modules into. This compiles to src/client.min.js, and is loaded into index.html.
